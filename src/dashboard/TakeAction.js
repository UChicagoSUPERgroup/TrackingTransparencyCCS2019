          <Text>
            <p>Several browser extensions serve as tracker blockers. These extensions prevent advertisers and other third-party services from tracking where and what you browse. Examples include <a href='https://www.eff.org/privacybadger' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Privacy Badger</a> and the <a href='https://duckduckgo.com/app' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>DuckDuckGo extension</a>. Some ad-blocking services may have this feature as well.</p>
            {isFirefox && <p>In Firefox, you can enable the built-in tracking protection feature. See <a href='https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tracking-protection' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a> for directions.</p>}
